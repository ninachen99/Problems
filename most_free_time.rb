=begin
Using the Ruby language, have the function MostFreeTime(strArr) 
read the strArr parameter being passed which will represent a full day 
and will be filled with events that span from time X to time Y in the day. 
The format of each event will be hh:mmAM/PM-hh:mmAM/PM. For example, 
strArr may be ["10:00AM-12:30PM","02:00PM-02:45PM","09:10AM-09:50AM"]. 
Your program will have to output the longest amount of free time available 
between the start of your first event and the end of your last event in the format: 
hh:mm. The start event should be the earliest event in the day and the latest event s
hould be the latest event in the day. The output for the previous input would therefore 
be 01:30 (with the earliest event in the day starting at 09:10AM and the latest event ending at 02:45PM). 
The input will contain at least 3 events and the events may be out of order.
